This program is designed to take a SoftMax plate reader exported text file and parse it based on a tab delimited plate map.  The parser will organize like samples together taken from each time point on a kinetics run.  It is designed to reduce the amount of copying and pasting required to organize kinetics data into something useful for various graphing and statistical analysis programs.
